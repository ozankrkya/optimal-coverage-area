## Optimal Coverage Area Focused Sensor Placement Problem & Solution

During the cmpE524 Course, Bogazici University - Fall2024, problem of sensor placement for optimal coverage in areas where the physical conditions can vary such as obstacles is studied. 

Solution I have came up is valid for 2D problems. Moreover, it is acknowledged that this solution is not the best solution available for these kind of problems, however, to create a better solution genetic algorithm usage is required and this solution can provide sufficient initial solutions for further solution algorithms.
